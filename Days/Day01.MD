## Let the journey begin

If you read the above blog, you will see this is a high-level contents for my learning journey and I will say at this point I am nowhere near an expert in any of these sections but what I wanted to do was share some resources both FREE and some paid for but an option for both as we all have different circumstances.

Over the next few days, I want to document these resources and cover those foundational areas. I would love for the community to also get involved. Share your journey and resources so we can learn in public and help each other.


## Why to Learn Spring?

- Spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise Java. Millions of developers around the world use Spring Framework to create high performing,    
  easily testable, and reusable code.

- Spring framework is an open source Java platform. It was initially written by Rod Johnson and was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003.

- Spring is lightweight when it comes to size and transparency. The basic version of Spring framework is around 2MB.

- The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE      
  platform. Spring framework targets to make J2EE development easier to use and promotes good programming practices by enabling a POJO-based programming model.
